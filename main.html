	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>

	<p>
		Time complexity is a way to represent how the runtime of an algorithm grows with the size of the input. 
		It helps us determine how efficient an algorithm is in terms of time taken to execute.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses during its execution. 
		Space Complexity is usually expressed as O(n) where n is the input size.
